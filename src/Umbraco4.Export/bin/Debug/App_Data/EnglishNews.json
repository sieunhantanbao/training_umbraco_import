The first function we would like to introduce you to is “Hanabi Aquarium by NAKED”, which includes a dolphin performance combined with projection mapping and artwork. The dolphin performance has two versions: a day version titled “INASE” and night version called “Hoshihanabi”. For INASE, the audience can enjoy the performance by dancing to Japanese-style music while remaining seated. As for Hoshihanabi, you can enjoy “Hanabi”. Although “Hanabi” has many forms, they are all the integrations of water, light, and the ocean world in which dolphins and colorful fish swim. Therefore, the “Hoshinabi” performance integrates a water curtain, projection mapping, and a dolphin performance. Such “Hanabi” paints the atmosphere of Aqua Park Shinagawa in “Japanese modernism”.</p><p><img src=\"/media/25109/image2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/25109/image2.jpeg\"></p><p>In addition to these performances, there are other things to do.

It then moved to the current location in Ariake, Koto-ku back in 1996. Being operated by the company K.K. Tokyo Big Sight, it has come to be widely known as “Tokyo Big Sight” over the years.</p><p>In this photo, you see the architecture shaped like up-side-down pyramids. This is this central meeting tower, connecting West and East Wings in the center. If you have been here, you must have felt that walking from one end of the building to the other end is quite exhausting because of its size!! Even to us energetic Servcorp staffs, it’s quite difficult to remain bright and cheerful after a long day of visiting the exhibitions.</p><p><img src=\"/media/24755/image2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24755/image2.jpeg\"></p><p>Have you ever wondered how large Tokyo Big Sight is?</p><p>You keep walking…</p><p><img src=\"/media/24756/image3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24756/image3.jpeg\"></p><p>You keep walking…</p><p>and walking… but never get to the end of the building.</p><p><img src=\"/media/24757/image4.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24757/image4.jpeg\"></p><p>As of 2016, Tokyo Big Sight is currently the largest convention center in Japan and the total exhibition area size is 80,000 square meters.

It’s not easy to imagine the facility six times as big as Tokyo Big Sight, is it?!</p><p><br>Let’s look at the ranking by countries.</p><p>Ranking #1: USA (Total 6.71 mil. square meters) <br>Ranking #2: China (Total 4.75 mil. square meters) <br>Ranking #3: Germany (Total 3.37 square meters)</p><p>These countries seem to strategically invest into the trade show business. <br>What would be the motivation and reason behind such investments?</p><p>Let's look at the characteristic of exhibitions.</p><p><br>1. Buyers travel from all over the world for the purpose of doing business <br>2. Negotiation and transaction can be done on the spot (It is the way to make sales!!) <br>3. Over thousands of competitors gather together in one place <br>4. The same trade show happens at the same place at the same time of the year <br>5.

The commercial facility “KITTE Nagoya” is located from the B1F to 3F within the building complex “JP Tower Nagoya. The main point of KITTE Nagoya is food. There are 11 restaurants in the restaurant area called, ”BIMI yokocho” at B1 floor. In total from B1 to the 3rd floor, including BIMI yokocho, there are 21 restaurants and stores related to foods. This time, we would like to introduce four highly recommended restaurants from BIMI yokocho!</p><p>1. Spaghetti House Yokoi</p><p><img src=\"/media/24718/image1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24718/image1.jpeg\"></p><p>(<a href=\"http://yokoi-anspa.jp/\" data-mce-href=\"http://yokoi-anspa.jp/\">http://yokoi-anspa.jp/</a>)</p><p>This restaurant is famous for its original ankake spaghetti which is Nagoya-meshi. Ankake Spaghetti is Spaghetti with Spicy and Sticky Sauce. Yokoi started their business about 50 years ago. There are restaurants in two locations in Nishiki and Sumiyoshi. Please enjoy the thick 2.2mm noodles covered in a unique rich and spicy sauce with black pepper, which is unlike any other normal spaghetti. If you come to Yokoi first time, it would be strongly recommended to order “Mirakan” which is synonymous with Yokoi!! <br> <br>2. TORIDASHIODEN SAMON</p><p><img src=\"/media/24719/image2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24719/image2.jpeg\"></p><p>(<a href=\"http://r.gnavi.co.jp/rjtpev2p0000/\" data-mce-href=\"http://r.gnavi.co.jp/rjtpev2p0000/\">http://r.gnavi.co.jp/rjtpev2p0000/</a>)</p><p>This store is run by a popular Yakitori company in Nisshin city next to Nagoya city. In addition to normal Oden, Shabu-shabu Nabe based on Oden soup is getting popular. The rich chicken based dashi oden is made by boiling select chicken bones and several kinds of vegetables for long time. In Nagoya, it is popular to eat oden with miso (the sweet miso is a distinct flavor of Nagoya). <br> <br>3. CONANA</p><p><img src=\"/media/24720/image3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24720/image3.jpeg\"></p><p>(<a href=\"http://www.conana-jp.com/\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.conana-jp.com/\">http://www.conana-jp.com/</a>)</p><p>This is every popular pasta restaurant in Kansai and Kanto. It is the first time to have a store in Nagoya, Tokai area! Wa-pasta is Japanese style pasta. The collaboration of Japanese and Western is irresistible! Our personal recommendation is the Aigamo and white green onion with sweet soy sauce, or the steamed chicken and green soybeans with white miso cream sauce. There are three different variations of each item depending if you want a miso sauce, a soy sauce or soy milk sauce base. Some flavors are unique to Conana. <br> <br>4. ERICK SOUTH</p><p><img src=\"/media/24721/image4.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24721/image4.jpeg\"></p><p>(<a href=\"http://enso.ne.jp/shop/441.html\" data-mce-href=\"http://enso.ne.jp/shop/441.html\">http://enso.ne.jp/shop/441.html</a>)</p><p>Erick South is new in the Tokai area! This is a restaurant specializing in South Indian curry and traditional South Indian food, which is currently the latest food trend in Tokyo. <br>The low fat curry with lots of beans and vegetables will grab women's attention. Please try “Erick Meals” which is the most popular south Indian set of meals. <br>Due to free refills for the rice and some other dishes, even men who have a big appetite will be satisfied with them. There are no preservatives, no artificial coloring, and no chemical condiments. Only authentic Indian curry with spices. Once you've tried it, you'll get hooked! <br> <br>There are some restaurants in KITTE Nagoya which already have a long queue outside the restaurant since TV programs and other media have focused on those restaurants. On top of that, there are lots of restaurants which have opened their first location in Nagoya here. Each restaurant offers wonderful customer service and great value. Clients in Nagoya using our coworking lounges, meeting rooms, and boardrooms at Servcorp Nagoya Lucent Tower will have the benefit of eating the tasty foods listed above. We are looking forward to hearing your comments on Nagoya-meshi (dishes specific to Nagoya).</p></div><p><strong>Nagoya Lucent Tower</strong> <br> Level 40 Nagoya Lucent Tower<br>6-1 Ushijima-cho Nishi-ku<br>Nagoya 451-6040 Japan<br> +81 52 569 1500<br></p>"},{"NodeName":"Nagoyas Time Killer Spot","PageName":"Nagoya’s time killer spot","PageTitle":"Nagoya’s time killer spotNagoya - News | Servcorp","MetaKeyword":"Nagoya’s time killer spot Nagoya, News, Servcorp","MetaDescription":"Nagoya’s time killer spot Nagoya - Servcorp News","HeaderScript":"&lt;meta name=&quot;verify-v1&quot; content=&quot;ihlVMluud6IqLkxYlJ4S2RKYyl97BGbrKIV1urVvNQU=&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;msvalidate.01&quot; content=&quot;A6AC4CC60D694349C8034F44A3F28EF0&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;link href=&quot;/media/8899/new.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; title=&quot;new style&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;style&gt;\n.article_naiyou {\n  width: 687px;\n}\n.article_naiyou h4 {\n  margin-top: 20px;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n.article_naiyou h4:first-child {\n  margin-top: 0;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n.article .article-content .textBody .article_naiyou p {\n  padding-bottom: 5px;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n.article .article-content .textBody p {\n  width: 687px;\n  padding: 10px 0 !important;\n}\n.article .article-content .textBody p:first-child {\n  padding-top: 0px !important;\n}\n.article .article-content .textBody img {\n  max-width: 687px;\n  display: block;\n   margin: 0 auto;\n}\nli.quotes {\n  width: 650px;\n  list-style: none;\n  margin: 10px 10px;\n  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(150, 150, 150, 0.5);\n  padding: 0 !important;\n}\n\nh1.location_title {\n  font-size: 20px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin: 19px 0;\n}\n\nh4.title {\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n  font-size: 1.4em;\n  text-decoration: underline;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  width: 712px;\n}\n\n.small {\n  font-size: 9px;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;","BodyFooterScript":"","IsFeature":true,"Title":"\n<p class=\"font-bold\">Nagoya's time killer spot</p>\n","DateCreated":"August 2016","Author":"Servcorp","Summary":"\nNagoya is famous for Hitsu-mabushi (Chopped grilled eel).

Bustling with commerce, entertainment, fashion and that distinct international flavor that makes it stand out from other districts across the metropolis. Apple, Google, a plethora of Global IT companies and financial institutions all call Roppongi home and the trend continues with more and more companies setting up shop.</p><p>Why is it that these multinationals have found Roppongi so attractive? We interviewed Roppongi based Shoji Ko, CEO of Japan Properties KK who has seen the area evolve from red-light district to vibrant epicenter in the space of a few decades.</p><p><img src=\"/media/24860/image1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24860/image1.jpeg\"></p><p><strong>- What is the reasoning behind the change? </strong><br>Since Roppongi Hills was completed in 2003 and following on from that Tokyo Midtown in 2007, Roppongi has changed dramatically. I would say these two massive developments changed the fabric of the area and were the catalysts in making Roppongi what it is today. The concept of Roppongi Hills was to make Roppongi an international cultural precinct and it was marketed to attract global investment in the local area. It wasn't long before Goldman Sachs and other big players had moved in. Also, by including residential and commercial facilities these two satellite cities created opportunities where people could have everything on their doorstep – a place to work, play and shop. Roppongi Hills even has a 9 screen cinema complex.</p><p><strong>- As a place to work, what is great about the area? </strong><br>Roppongi has become a magnet for people, retailers, business, and money. Obviously by working here, you become part of this vibrant world and that is why I think the area is attractive.</p><p><strong>- And for dining over business? </strong><br>Roppongi Hills 51st floor has the very exclusive ‘Roppongi Hills Club' where there are no shortage of Japanese and Western style restaurants to enjoy executive style dining. I guess you could say it was Roppongi Hills that set the bar high for the standard that followed.</p><p><img src=\"/media/24861/image2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24861/image2.jpeg\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(Roppongi Hills, also known as the Mori Building)</em></p><p><strong>- How do business people connect in Roppongi? </strong><br>Office warming parties are quite common here in Roppongi. Unlike other parts of Tokyo, when a new tenant moves in to a premises they often invite the neighbors. While the business area of Roppongi Minato-Ku is in fact very large, the opportunities to encounter like-minded professionals are so many, that in fact it's not uncommon to feel part of a real and tangible business community.</p><p><strong>- What about famous bars where executives and the like gather? </strong><br>I dare not say the name of the bar, but yes, I know of at least one place where the who's who in business likes to gather. Executives, presidents of multinationals, entrepreneurs, you name it. There are drinking holes to cater for any clientele and any budget in Roppongi.</p><p>A large number of angel investors (affluent individuals who provide capital to start-ups) also live in the area, so it is not unusual to become acquainted with those types.</p><p><strong>- What about getting in and around Roppongi? </strong><br>Roppongi is connected by no less than three subway lines. There is also a reliable bus network and as for taxis, you can get to Shinjuku for 2,000 yen and to neighboring Shibuya for less than 1,500.</p><p><strong>- And Roppongi as an environment? </strong><br>Since Roppongi is a global city, there is a real diversity of people living here. It is a place where ideas come to life with vigor and that in itself is exciting.</p><p><strong>- Why do you think movers and shakers aim straight for Roppongi? </strong><br>As for Roppongi Hills, it is entirely powered by gas and thus has zero possibility of a power failure which must provide huge peace of mind to its tenants. When Apple and Google moved into Hills, they would have been thinking about this in a city that is prone to strong quakes. On another front, I feel it was these companies which led the way for Roppongi's growth and subsequently attracted many IT companies into the area as well.</p><p><img src=\"/media/24862/image3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24862/image3.jpeg\"></p><p><strong>- What sets Roppongi apart from other commercial districts like Shinjuku, Shibuya or Ikebukuro? </strong><br>First of all, the people that live in those districts and the companies that are situated there are completely different to Roppongi. Shinjuku and Ikebukuro attract businesses catering toward the individual, Shibuya, which has Japanese IT companies such as GMO and other cyber agents tend to attract the startup types.</p><p><strong>- What do you mean by ‘the people are different'? </strong><br>I think that can be understood when actually working in Roppongi. Roppongi is truly international. It has its fair share of foreign tourists, but more than this, you will see many non-Japanese business people. If a company has a view to expanding into Japan, I would totally recommend Roppongi to get a solid foothold into the country.</p><p><strong>- For venture companies and start-up companies, where do you think the benefits lie in choosing Roppongi? </strong><br>Again, it all comes down to being able to network. Your ability and talent to network is one thing, but in Roppongi, the opportunities are endless so I think that is important. In addition, Roppongi Hills is right there towering over you and in some kind of way motivates you to want to rise to the top.</p><p><img src=\"/media/24863/image4.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24863/image4.jpeg\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(View from Roppongi Hills roof toward Tokyo Bay)</em></p><p><strong>- What are the advantages and disadvantages that you yourself feel by being situated in Roppongi? </strong><br>Well, the number one benefit is that I am able to make horizontal connections easily. Especially for work, because I am seen as a Roppongi expert. As for disadvantages, I don't really feel any. When it comes down to it, even at night I love the way it's so lively.</p><p><strong>- I would like to ask about renting office space in Roppongi. How much does a standard office go for? </strong><br>It depends on the building. In a mid-size ordinary building, it is perhaps around 20,000JPY to 25,000JPY per tsubo. And in a place like Roppongi Hills or Midtown, you are looking at around 35,000 JPY to 40,000 JPY per tsubo. There is however almost 100 percent occupancy rate at Roppongi Hills. It hardly ever goes on the market.</p><p><strong>- Is that expensive compared to other business districts? </strong><br>It's cheaper than Shibuya. It's about the same though as Akasaka, Aoyama and Ebisu.</p><p><strong>- There is a belief that for small companies just starting up, setting up an office in Roppongi is really challenging. Would you agree? </strong><br>I would. Roppongi is very international and has a large proportion of foreign companies with money to invest. To get set up as a small Japanese realtor in the area was really challenging. Everyone asks for 10-12 month deposits! That's where serviced offices come in. They usually require much shorter deposit timeframes, and really reduce the cost and effort of establishing an office from scratch.</p><p><strong>- In terms of the time it takes for approval, that is where a serviced office can be a great option too, right? </strong><br>If you really want to make an impact in the short-term, I think a serviced office is a great option. You don't need to consider all those hidden costs, furniture is provided and you can start immediately. A really good method is to start with a serviced office, and then after two years after you get really established, you can transition to your own space. The benefits of a serviced office can be seen in the initial upfront costs. Very short-term contractual arrangements are available and you can start business on the day you sign the contract. Renting your own office will tie you up for two years – and you have to pay a huge upfront deposit. You may like the idea of having furniture that matches your taste, but you have to pay for it, and also set it up yourself. Then there is the IT and employing staff. In order to create an environment where employees can work takes time and money. After that, even if you do manage the enormous upfront costs, you may not even pass the tenant screening.</p><p><strong>- What does the future hold for Roppongi? </strong><br>Global blue chip companies are still swarming to Roppongi and there is good reason for it. There are a variety of development plans slated for the area in the near future. The 2nd Roppongi Hills plan, the rebuilding of the Hotel Ibis and other hotels, the development around the crossing are just a few of the projects in development. The current trend is set to continue as an ever increasing conglomerate of multinationals choose Roppongi as their address.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Servcorp Tri-Seven Roppongi Now Open!</strong></span></p><p>In late July Servcorp opened an entire floor of serviced offices in the newly completed \"Tri-Seven Roppongi\" across from the Tokyo Midtown and 3min walk from Roppongi Station. The location is unbeatable in that it is right in the center of the triangle of Roppongi Hills, Tokyo Midtown the National Art Gallery.

Nagoya, especially around Nagoya station, is now undergoing huge changes.</p><p>The Tokyo-Nagoya Linear Chuo Shinkansen Line (bullet-train) will open in about 10 years. In the past few years, the area near around Nagoya station has been changed to match the fast pace of recent urban development. The city of Nagoya is expected to continue changing significantly for at least 10 years or until the opening of the new bullet-train line and beyond. <br>The Linear Chuo Shinkansen Line is will connect Tokyo and Nagoya in as little as 40 minutes. It will integrate the Greater Tokyo Area and Chukyo metropolitan area, making it a giant metropolitan area and a large economic bloc. It is said that the economic effect will be somewhere to the tune of about 10,000,000,000,000 yen over 50 years. The station construction and maintenance have been carried out by several railroad companies and local government. The urban structure it will integrate, such as the whole Nagoya metropolitan area including surrounding cities like Sakae, has been under considerable consideration.</p><p><img src=\"/media/24531/image1.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24531/image1.jpg\"></p><p>There has been the opening of large commercial buildings around Nagoya station, development in the network of underground shopping malls which is synonymous with Nagoya, and in addition to that, there will be more successive redevelopment around Nagoya station.</p><p>As a result, Nagoya is becoming a popular and very lively city in recent years because this redevelopment is expected to bring lots of company offices, which means the number of workers/businesspeople in Nagoya will increase. Therefore the number of restaurants or shops have been increasing rapidly.</p><p>Servcorp Nagoya Lucent Tower is located in Sakae, the central business district, and has great access because it is directly connected to Nagoya station which is connected to the Shinkansen station, and also has a direct route to the Central Japan International Airport. Moreover, since Servcorp is on 40th floor, the top floor, it provides great views over Nagoya from the reception area. These views give visitors inner peace and make a great impression on their clients.</p><p><img src=\"/media/24532/image2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24532/image2.jpg\"></p><p>In regards to the fact that Tokyo and Nagoya will only lie 40 minutes from each other after the opening of the Linear Shinkansen Line, it is assumed that Nagoya area will become more globalized due to the increased access to Nagoya from the airport in Tokyo, and access to the greater Tokyo area from the Central Japan International Airport via Nagoya station. Therefore, it is entitled “Super Terminal, Nagoya”, Nagoya city is aiming at making an international level of the terminal which is easy and convenient to transfer.</p><p><img src=\"/media/24533/image3.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24533/image3.jpg\"></p><p>Due to the mere 40 minutes ride, people will more easily travel on business as if it was like a commute to their own office. Companies in the Greater Tokyo area or Nagoya will be free to use offices in at a CBD address during when traveling on business by using Servcorp which provides various types of meeting rooms and boardrooms. Free tea and coffee, and fast and secure Wi-Fi are also conveniently provided.</p><p>Office availability around Nagoya station has been dropped in past few years due to this redevelopment, and it also have a big influence on the land value, and Office rents in Nagoya have edged closer than ever before to those in larger Osaka, and the result of opening linear will likely push rent even higher. However, the movement of offices to around Nagoya station seems to continue due to the expectation of the advantage of business or hiring activities. So the flexible month-by-month contracts and the cost-effective services, such as support services by bilingual secretaries, will be the key to succeeding in the new Nagoya.</p><p>From now on. There will be a great deal of attention paid to the drastically changing Nagoya.</p></div><p><strong>Nagoya Lucent Tower</strong> <br> Level 40 Nagoya Lucent Tower<br>6-1 Ushijima-cho Nishi-ku<br>Nagoya 451-6040 Japan<br> +81 52 569 1500<br> <a href=\"mailto:lucent@servcorp.co.jp\" data-mce-href=\"mailto:lucent@servcorp.co.jp\"> lucent@servcorp.co.jp </a></p>"},{"NodeName":"Our Top 3 Activities Around Yusen Building","PageName":"Our Top 3 Activities Around Yusen Building","PageTitle":"Our Top 3 Activities Around Yusen Building - News | Servcorp","MetaKeyword":"Our Top 3 Activities Around Yusen Building, News, Servcorp","MetaDescription":"Our Top 3 Activities Around Yusen Building - Servcorp News","HeaderScript":"&lt;meta name=&quot;verify-v1&quot; content=&quot;ihlVMluud6IqLkxYlJ4S2RKYyl97BGbrKIV1urVvNQU=&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;msvalidate.01&quot; content=&quot;A6AC4CC60D694349C8034F44A3F28EF0&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;link href=&quot;/media/8899/new.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; title=&quot;new style&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;style&gt;\n.article_naiyou {\n  width: 687px;\n}\n.article_naiyou h4 {\n  margin-top: 20px;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n.article_naiyou h4:first-child {\n  margin-top: 0;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n.article .article-content .textBody .article_naiyou p {\n  padding-bottom: 5px;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n.article .article-content .textBody p {\n  width: 687px;\n  padding: 10px 0 !important;\n}\n.article .article-content .textBody p:first-child {\n  padding-top: 0px !important;\n}\n.article .article-content .textBody img {\n  max-width: 687px;\n  display: block;\n   margin: 0 auto;\n}\nli.quotes {\n  width: 650px;\n  list-style: none;\n  margin: 10px 10px;\n  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(150, 150, 150, 0.5);\n  padding: 0 !important;\n}\n\nh1.location_title {\n  font-size: 20px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin: 19px 0;\n}\n\nh4.title {\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n  font-size: 1.4em;\n  text-decoration: underline;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  width: 712px;\n}\n\n.small {\n  font-size: 9px;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;","BodyFooterScript":"","IsFeature":true,"Title":"\n<p class=\"font-bold\">Our Top 3 Activities Around Yusen Building</p>\n","DateCreated":"June 2016","Author":"Servcorp","Summary":"\n<p>Marunouchi is in a beautiful fashionable office district full of\ngreenery that spreads to The Imperial Palace from Tokyo Station.\nThis time we will introduce our 3 recommended activities which are\nmost popular amongst our Servcorp Marunouchi Yusen office clients\nand teams.</p>\n","Thumnail":"24572/thumb.jpg","A_Title":"Our Top 3 Activities Around Yusen Building","A_Date":"June 2016 ","A_Author":"Servcorp","A_Content":"<div class=\"article_naiyou\"><p>Marunouchi is in a beautiful fashionable office district full of greenery that spreads to The Imperial Palace from Tokyo Station.

It is great access and no worries even on a rainy day. In this farmers market, you can buy the carefully natured fresh vegetables, fruits, nuts, seasonings and drinks. And most of them are not sold in regular supermarkets in Tokyo. Rental office clients of Yusen Building like to shop seasonal ingredients each farmer has grown with passion after work for dinner or for their family and friends. In addition, our Servcorp staff even come here from far to get some delicious bread. We hope you can get some before they are sold out!</p><p>You get 1 point every 500 JPY spent.

During the Edo period, various daimyo constructed their lavish residences outside the castle until the end of the Tokugawa shogunate and the start of the Meiji period in the 1860s. The various daimyo families lost their lots as the district was possessed by the government, who constructed various governmental offices such as Ministry of Interior, Finance and Education. Otemachi used to be government district for a period of time. In 1952, the government decided to move decentralized government offices to Kasumigaseki and sell the district into private hands in order to gain revenue. Afterwards, lots of new buildings were built one after another in the period of high economic growth (1970’s -1980’s) and Otemachi district was dynamically changed as today’s central business district. Nothing remains of its residential past, the district is dotted with modern high-rise buildings which is continued from Marunouchi district.</p><p><img src=\"/media/24453/image2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24453/image2.jpeg\"></p><p>Otemachi Redevelopment Project <br>After 2000’s, high-rise buildings which were built in the period of high economic growth (1970’s -1980’s) are increasingly aging recently.

It's not just an observatory deck where you can appreciate the view from Sunshine 60, but an observatory deck where you can experience the skies of Tokyo to the fullest. Seven areas await you, where you can see, touch, feel and be amazed. Get ready to be amazed! Highlights are ‘playful content' with the latest virtual reality technology and 4D simulation, ‘various technologies' making full use of CG animation, ‘The View' offering an impressive 360-degree panoramic view of places where you can feel the sky, heaven, and earth, and finally ‘People creating something new', an area with where people can enjoy 60 different large kaleidoscopes . By the way, speaking of a great view, you can also experience a spectacular view from the Servcorp reception on the 45th floor!</p><img src=\"/media/24408/Sunshine%20Observatory%20Seung-Yeon%203.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24408/Sunshine%20Observatory%20Seung-Yeon%203.jpg\"><p>To find out how ‘experience-oriented' the renovated observatory is, the Servcorp Sunshine 60 manager and secretary attended the pre-opening of the observatory! <br>Here is the short report from Servcorp:</p><img src=\"/media/24407/Sunshine%20Observatory%20Owl%20goods.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24407/Sunshine%20Observatory%20Owl%20goods.jpg\"><p>‘When you hear the word ‘observatory deck', people usually imagine ‘just somescenery from high places' but Sky Circus is truly an experience and it's fun! I especially enjoyed ‘Infinity Scape' and ‘Tokyo Bullet Flight'. At ‘Infinity Scape' you can experience the magical four seasons of the year surrounded by mirrors and lights. At ‘Tokyo Bullet Flight' you can experience visiting many different sight-seeing spots as if you were flying around from place to place. <br>At the Souvenir shop, you will find many adorable ‘owl' goods which is also a theme of Servcorp Sunshine (the Owl is the symbol of Ikebukuro since it is called ‘fukurou' in Japanese which sounds similar to the word ‘Ikebukuro' and it is believed to bring a good luck). I would love to visit there again after work and with my family on weekends.</p><img src=\"/media/24410/Sunshine%20Observatory%20Tokyo%20Bullet%20Flight.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-mce-src=\"/media/24410/Sunshine%20Observatory%20Tokyo%20Bullet%20Flight.jpg\"><p>‘The new Observatory is totally different compared to the previous one. It is modern and entertaining. <br>The whole area is experience based and I especially liked the Kaleido Scape area where you can see spectacular views as if you are looking through a kaleidoscope. It is such a cool and fun place where you would definitely like to visit after work!'</p><p>Do you feel like visiting now? It is such an exciting place to visit when you need a break from work especially in this rainy season! You may come up with a brand new idea for your successful business. When you come up with a new idea, Servcorp Sunshine is the place to visit! Just comedown the elevator to the 45th floor. We provide a serviced/rental office, coworking space and a meeting room ideal for start-up businesses, venture businesses and small businesswa where you can start your business on the same day!

This 60 year old motor show was first held at Hibiya Park in 1954 and this year the anniversary was commemorated with a parade through Tokyo a week before the opening of the show. Over 70 passenger vehicles and motorcycles from 1958 to 2014 that symbolize each era were on the Parade that went from Ginza to Hibiya Park to Nihonbashi and back to Ginza.</p><p style=\"padding-bottom: 5px;\" data-mce-style=\"padding-bottom: 5px;\"><img title=\"Tokyo Motor Show 2015 official Poster from <a href=&quot;http://lightpaintingphotography.com/&quot;>Light Painting Phototography</a>\" src=\"http://lightpaintingphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jan-Leonardo-Light-Painting-Tokyo-Motor-Show1.jpg\" alt=\"Tokyo Motor Show 2015 official Poster\" width=\"400\" data-mce-src=\"http://lightpaintingphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jan-Leonardo-Light-Painting-Tokyo-Motor-Show1.jpg\"></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0; font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\" data-mce-style=\"margin-top: 0; font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\">Tokyo Motor Show 2015 official Poster from <a href=\"http://lightpaintingphotography.com/\" data-mce-href=\"http://lightpaintingphotography.com/\">Light Painting Phototography</a></p><p>Many Japanese brands were on show alongside some of the big Western car manufacturers.

Car brands and car parts manufactures are historic clients of Servcorp both in Tokyo and in our serviced offices in Nagoya, where the heart of the car industry is located.</p><p>Due to popular demand, Servcorp created special meeting room or office packages to accommodate for the clients who once or twice a year need short term access to an office, meeting space or project space whilst they attend business at Tokyo Big Sight. A lot of business opportunities arise at exhibitions and trade shows in Tokyo Big Sight. The ability to access an office or a Boardroom away from the busy and noisy exhibition halls, will not only impress your clients, but provide the perfect environment to close a deal and make more sales for your business.</p><p>The Servcorp serviced offices official mascot, named “Sidney, the world's wisest wombat” was happy to sit in his vintage Mercedes-Benz 500K roadster from 1936!</p><p><img src=\"/media/23632/2.jpg\" alt=\"servcorp's mascot sidney at tokyo big sight\" width=\"700\" height=\"718\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23632/2.jpg\"></p>"},{"NodeName":"Our top 5 restaurant choice around Tokyo Station","PageName":"Our top 5 restaurant choice around Tokyo Station","PageTitle":"Our top 5 restaurant choice around Tokyo Station","MetaKeyword":"Our top 5 restaurant choice around Tokyo Station,　News, Servcorp","MetaDescription":"Our top 5 restaurant choice around Tokyo Station - Servcorp News","HeaderScript":"&lt;meta name=&quot;verify-v1&quot; content=&quot;ihlVMluud6IqLkxYlJ4S2RKYyl97BGbrKIV1urVvNQU=&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;msvalidate.01&quot; content=&quot;A6AC4CC60D694349C8034F44A3F28EF0&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;link href=&quot;/media/8898/new.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; title=&quot;new style&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;style&gt;\n.article .article-content .textBody p {\n  width: 687px;\n}\n\n.article .article-content .textBody h2 {\n  font-size: 20px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin: 19px 0;\n  width: 687px;\n}\n\n.article .article-content .textBody img {\n  max-width: 687px;\n  display: block;\n   margin: 0 auto;\n}\nli.quotes {\n  width: 650px;\n  list-style: none;\n  margin: 10px 10px;\n  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(150, 150, 150, 0.5);\n  padding: 0 !important;\n}\n\nh2.location_title {\n  font-size: 20px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin: 19px 0;\n  width: 687px;\n}\n\nh4.title {\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n  font-size: 1.4em;\n  text-decoration: underline;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  width: 712px;\n}\n\n.small {\n  font-size: 9px;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;","BodyFooterScript":"","IsFeature":true,"Title":"\n<p class=\"font-bold\"><strong>Our top 5 restaurant choice around\nTokyo Station</strong></p>\n","DateCreated":"November 2015","Author":"Servcorp","Summary":"\n<p>Do you want to have a business lunch nearby the Marunouchi Trust\nTower-Main location and Tokyo Station?

It is a festival which celebrates the tradition of welcoming the summer in Hakata, and has been held for 774 years.</p><p>In this festival, men wear “happi”, traditional Japanese clothing, and carry a one-ton float called a “yama” (or mountain). It is a sight to be seen!</p><p>The men who carry the “yama” do so while calling out “oisa!” and shoulder the heavy float for 5 kilometers, all the while those from the roadside will throw water on them called “kioimizu” or water of vigor.</p><p>Servcorp's mascot, Sidney the wombat, feeling all the energy coming from the festival, decided to don the Japanese “happi” as well to get in the festival spirit.

Even though some people may view that as a lot or only a few, if we break down the answers we find out that the most frequent responses were “attending networking events invited by friends/acquaintances” and “having the clients/suppliers introduce someone to them.” Which means that a lot of people rely on their existing connections rather than starting from scratch and approaching new people/places.</p><p>These days there are several opportunities to make connections such as multi-industry networking events, networking among start-ups, seminars, or even venture and investor matching events. Information about events like these can be easily found on the web, but despite the convenience, the fact that active networking has taken a backseat gives the impression that most people prefer to network passively.</p><p><br></p><h4 class=\"title\">Have you ever felt like networking wasn't effective?</h4><p>When asked the following: “Amongst the networking activities you have tried, were there any that you have felt were ineffective?” Approximately 70% responded with “yes”, saying that they had times when they felt it was not effective.</p><p><img src=\"http://admin.servcorp.co.jp/media/23278/networking_ineffective.jpg\" alt=\"amongst the networking activities you have tried were there any that you have felt were ineffective? 72% no. 28% yes.\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23278/networking_ineffective.jpg\"></p><p>So what are some examples of networking activities that were ineffective? We've shared a couple below for your reference:</p><ul><li class=\"quotes\">“Old acquaintances and connections from my previous companies tend to have some complications, so I have started avoiding them” (Male/55 years old/Lease, Rental)</li><li class=\"quotes\">“Meeting with parents/siblings of my child's friends was unproductive.”(Male/63 years old/Wholesale, Retail)</li><li class=\"quotes\">“I have participated in networking events held by political organizations, but it felt like I would lose more than gain from my involvement, so I haven't been going.” (Male/58 years old/Manufacturing)</li><li class=\"quotes\">“Meet ups via SNS and over the internet have not given me any business opportunities, especially since you don't know what the person looks like and thus it's hard to understand their true intentions.”(Male/51 years old/IT)</li></ul><p>On the other hand, people who continue to actively network said the following about their experiences:</p><ul><li class=\"quotes\">“There are more times that networking has been ineffective, but by continuing, I've started to see good results.”(Male/58 years old/Manufacturing)</li><li class=\"quotes\">“I don't think that networking produces immediate results.

The overall average is 10,570 yen with most businesses keeping their entertainment expenses within 60% of their business earnings. Given that, let's delve into some of the underlying reasons regarding entertainment expenses.</p><h4 style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\" data-mce-style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\">&nbsp;</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\" data-mce-style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Are you FOR or AGAINST entertainment expenses?</strong></span></h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, let's take a look at how people perceive these expenses. We've categorized the answers into 4 different groups:</p><p>1. The “Actively FOR group”</p><p>2. The “Passively FOR group”</p><p>3. The “Not necessary group”</p><p>4. The “Unconcerned group”</p><ul><li class=\"quotes\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The “Actively FOR group” says:</span></strong></li><li class=\"quotes\">“Some conversations over drinks do lead to business opportunities from time to time.” (Male/50 years old/Video Creation)</li><li class=\"quotes\">“I don't mind if it doesn't produce results immediately.” (Male/52 years old/Wholesale, Retail)</li><li class=\"quotes\">“I'm able to strengthen the relationship with someone I have met at a networking event.” (Male/53 years old/IT Company)</li><li class=\"quotes\">“It allows me to open up a new field.” (Male/36 years old/Service Industry)</li></ul><p>From the responses, even if the group is “actively FOR” entertainment expenses, only a handful seem to have been able to turn their connections into a business opportunity. The most common perceptions were comments such as “it's hard to know when your entertainment expense has led to a business opportunity. What's important is for others to know your existence as much as possible”(Male/45 years old/Construction, Real Estate) or “I see it as an investment, for others to understand my personality first before talking business.” (Male/38 years old/Broker, Agency)</p><p>Therefore, people in this group perceive entertainment expense as an investment for strengthening relationship with others rather than for getting new business deals. When looking at trends among different industries, it appears that service industries take up the majority of this group.</p><ul><li class=\"quotes\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The “Passively FOR group” says:</span></strong></li><li class=\"quotes\">“It hasn't produced much of a result, but I will continue to spend.” (Male/59 years old/Construction, Real Estate)</li><li class=\"quotes\">“I have only spent it on meals and it hasn't really led to many business opportunities.” (Male/64 years old/Medical, Welfare, Education)</li><li class=\"quotes\">“I spend just enough to keep people from forgetting me.”(Male/53 years old/IT)</li><li class=\"quotes\">“I have no policy to actively spend on entertainment fees” (Male/51 years old/IT)</li></ul><p>Even within “Passively FOR group” there is a spectrum of opinion ranging from those who do not want these expenses, but feel it's inevitable, and those who have a taken a firm stance that these expenses are a necessity. The following quotes illustrate this point:</p><p>“If possible, I don't want to spend any money, but it's inevitable” (Male/58 years old/Medical, Welfare, Education)</p><p>“Purchasing seasonal gifts to my customers is a must.” (Male/54 years old/Medical, Welfare, Education)</p><p>The most common responses were, “you do need to spend some money” and “I will spend if necessary”.

While it goes without saying that everybody's compatibility is different, it's safe to say that everybody has experienced difficulties with differences in each generation's values and approaches to hierarchy. Given this concept, we surveyed 400 workers, including both experienced employees in their 40s-50s as well as younger employees in their 20s and 30s, asking about the “type of person you like to work with” and “difference in work values based on different generations.” The goal of this survey is to provide some insight on <em>how to interact with other employees</em> and <em>how to build better relationships with others</em>.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><h4 style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\" data-mce-style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Personality preferences</strong></span></h4><p><img src=\"/media/23251/img001-en.jpg\" alt=\"survey showing results of a working survey\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23251/img001-en.jpg\"></p><p>The results of the survey show that “talkative people” were preferred to those who are quiet at 60.3%, as it seems that people want a work environment in which they can communicate with others. Also, “people who always agree” were less preferable to their contrary counterparts (at 66.0%). Furthermore, people who tend to “become silent” were much preferred to those who get outwardly angry (69.6%). Therefore, it appears that <strong>people who have their own opinions and can speak their mind are preferred over “yes-men”</strong> (people who tend to say “yes” to anything); however, most would like to avoid people who become outwardly angry.</p><p>Conversely, on the business operations side of things, “people who remember things slowly but never forget” were preferred to the fast but forgetful at 71.3%. In addition, people “who work slowly but produce good quality” were preferable to those who are fast and sloppy at 74.5%. The takeaway is that it seems everyone can appreciate <strong>quality and content</strong> more-so than <strong>speed </strong>alone.</p><p>Lastly, those “who prioritize efficiency and logic” were supported more than “people who value human nature and emotions” at 62.0%. At the same time, there seems to have been a fairly even split between “people who put emphasis on the process” versus those who “put emphasis on the end-goal” with the latter having received more support at 57.3%. Here we see that<strong> people value getting work done efficiently</strong>, <em>but not necessarily at the cost of ignoring the entire work process</em>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.4em;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.4em;\">Drawing the Line</span> </strong></h4><p><img src=\"/media/23252/img002-en.jpg\" alt=\"a graph showing the result of a survey that show where people draw the line between work and private life\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23252/img002-en.jpg\"></p><p>Where does work end and private life begin? Just how much should we be going out with people from work? Sometimes it's hard to tell where we should draw the line. According to our survey, it seems that <strong>those outings with partners from work weren't much important to most</strong>. 71.0% said spending time with co-workers on holidays is “not important” while 76.1% of respondents said that spending leisure time with their boss “is not important”.</p><p><em>However</em>, <strong>that's not to say we keep our work and home lives separate</strong>. Matters related to extending work-related conversations were all mostly considered important. That being said, we tend to prefer talking to our co-workers rather than bosses. More specifically, we value chatting with co-workers (about family, hobbies, etc.) (66.8%) over going for lunch with co-workers (64.6%) or going for drinks with co-workers (64.3%).</p><p>While it may be hard to tell what kind of relationships we should have with our co-workers, other practices seem to be clearer. For example, “greeting people in the workplace” and “keeping a clean desk” both had over 90% of respondents saying they were important. Here it seems <strong>as working adults there are rules and manners we must observe</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.4em;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.4em;\">Different strokes for different age groups </span> </strong></h4><p>Findings based on different age groups</p><h4><img src=\"/media/23253/img003-en.jpg\" alt=\"a chart showing whether people think having lunch with their boss\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23253/img003-en.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/23254/img004-en.jpg\" alt=\"a chart showing whether people think it is important to go our for drinks with their boss during non-business hours\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23254/img004-en.jpg\"></h4><p>What it means to have good communication with one's boss seems to have differed among the different age groups and while it sounds safe to assume that it's the older generations that value this old ethic, surprisingly the results show that younger people actually thought it was more important to engage in activities like “going drinking” and “having lunch” with one's superiors. The survey showed that as respondents got older, they tended to answer that these activities were “not important”. We can expect that this may be because <strong>those who have been around for longer have better understandings of their role at work</strong>, as well as how to interact with others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\" data-mce-style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Work values</strong></span></h4><p><img src=\"/media/23255/img005-en.jpg\" alt=\"graphs showing whether people work well with those that don't share the same work values\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23255/img005-en.jpg\"></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Opinions toward bosses and experienced employees</strong></span></p><p>“I want them to stop changing their attitude just because they're in a bad mood.” <em>(46/Female/Tokyo)</em></p><p>“I wish they ccould think more about their subordinates and stand up for us.” <em>(31/Male/Nagasaki)</em></p><p>“I would them to refrain from working individually.” <em>(27/Male/Ibaraki)</em></p><p>“I'd like for them to be better at dividing the work properly and also improve on making unbiased allocations of work.” <em>(29/Female/Tokyo)</em></p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Opinions towards co-workers</span></strong></p><p>“I would like them to work efficiently.” <em>(31/Female/Kanagawa)</em></p><p>“I know some people like things to ‘just be a certain way', but I would prefer that they keep that to themselves.” <em>(29/Female/Kyoto)</em></p><p>“When it comes to work, I'd rather people not try to get their personal feelings involved.” <em>(30/Male/Tokyo)</em></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Opinions towards subordinates and younger/less experience employees</strong></span></p><p>“I like them to consider how they ask for things, their attitudes, and how they should deal with people before they act.” (44/Male/Kanagawa)</p><p>“I would like them to think about things more flexibly.” (29/Female/Tokyo)</p><p>“I would like them to be more independent.” (28/Male/Kyoto)</p><p><strong>Overall</strong>, the majority of people responded that things are going well with those who don't share their work-values, but over 20% of people in their 20s and 30s and over 30% of people in their 40s and 50s responded that they did <em>not</em> think things were going well.</p><p style=\"color: gray; margin-left: 50px; font-size: 1.25em;\" data-mce-style=\"color: gray; margin-left: 50px; font-size: 1.25em;\">| \"I wish my boss would see the big picture.\"</p><p>Looking at the free-responses, there was a tendency for people to hope for more from their bosses with responses like, I wish my boss would “see the big picture”, or “not determine things emotionally”, and “think about the team rather than themselves”. And, concerning the boss's role as a coach and mentor, there was a good amount of people who wished that their bosses would, as one respondent said, “not just shoot [them] down but remember to give more constructive advice as well” (28/Female/Osaka).</p><p>And concerning opinions of those who were in similar level positions, people tended to hope that their co-workers would “do their jobs efficiently” while “not forcing their values” on them.</p><p>Also, they feel that there is a lack of “a sense of responsibility towards work” in subordinates and younger/less experienced employees such as lacking initiative, aggressiveness and proper manners. &nbsp;</p><p style=\"color: gray; margin-left: 50px; font-size: 1.25em;\" data-mce-style=\"color: gray; margin-left: 50px; font-size: 1.25em;\">| \"I don't want people to use their own standards to measure our work\"</p><p>When it came to people's values among different occupations, there seemed to be some friction with people saying things such as, “I don't want the company to just follow company policy, I want them to give priority to making a better working environment for researchers” (53/Male/Akita) and “when it comes to sales, I don't want people to use their own standards to measure our work” (39/Male/Chiba). Overall, it seems that most want others to take pride in their work, be able to effectively communicate with others, and be able to make decisions objectively.</p><p>Furthermore, when comparing different generations, it's important to notice that those in their 20s and 30s responded more positively than those in their 40s and 50s saying that things “were going well” by over 10 percent. So, for those who are saying that things are “going well”, just how are they interacting with those at work that have different work values?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\" data-mce-style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>How are we dealing with it?</strong></span></h4><p><img src=\"/media/23256/img006-en.jpg\" alt=\"a graph showing the ways in which people deal with a co-worker that may not share the same work values as them\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23256/img006-en.jpg\"></p><p>Here, we'll look at the methods of people who responded with either “things are going well” or “things are going pretty well”.</p><p>Firstly,<em> for those who are in the 20s – 30s age group</em>, the most popular method, at 34% of respondents, was to conform to the person who does not share the same work values. Basically, they <strong>change their own behavior to match the person's that they may not get along with</strong>.</p><p>On the other hand, <em>most of the experienced employees</em> in their 40s and 50s responded that they <strong>would rather try to make an effort to convince others</strong> to “understand their own preferences”, with about 34.2% of respondents in this category.</p><p>Experienced employees and people in the management level also have a duty to guide those under them, so they tend to make effort to get others to understand the big picture and the overall company goals. Therefore, compared to the younger people, the experienced/managerial employees tended to possess more experience and confidence in their voice while <strong>having the skills to persuade people they may not get along with</strong>. Oppositely, younger people may have the tendency to agree with their bosses and think that “it's just easier to go along with them on this one”.</p><p>Lastly, over 20% of experienced employees as well as younger people answered that they would try to “avoid the person”. It may be that the phrase “a wise man keeps away from danger” rings true when dealing with someone who never listens to you anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\" data-mce-style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h4><p>Even if there's someone you might not get along with, if you can't get your work done smoothly, you run the risk of losing your reputation in the company. In the case of young people, those who try their best to absorb lots of different things at work are usually loved and grow <strong>because of their flexibility</strong>. And in the case of the experienced employees/managers, while they have the power to influence others, <strong>the ability to understand others is desired at the same time</strong>.</p><p>Of course, using any of these methods to deal with those that “don't share the same work values” may be effective in helping things go smoothly, but if you change your ways, people around you tend to change their ways as well. In other words, performing in a way that is respected by your peers, bosses or subordinates, may be the best shortcut to building good lasting relations at work.</p>"},{"NodeName":"Marunouchi Trust Tower main office expansion!","PageName":"Marunouchi Trust Tower main office expansion!","PageTitle":"Marunouchi Trust Tower main office expansion! - Servcorp News","MetaKeyword":"Marunouchi Trust Tower main office expansion!,　News, Servcorp","MetaDescription":"Marunouchi Trust Tower main office expansion! - Servcorp News","HeaderScript":"","BodyFooterScript":"","IsFeature":true,"Title":"\n<p class=\"font-bold\"><strong>Marunouchi Trust Tower main office\nexpansion!</strong></p>\n","DateCreated":"June 2015","Author":"Servcorp","Summary":"\n<p>Servcorp's popular Marunouchi Trust Tower location has now just\nexpanded its office floor!</p>\n","Thumnail":"23130/trust","A_Title":"Marunouchi Trust Tower main office expansion!","A_Date":"June 2015","A_Author":"Servcorp","A_Content":"<p align=\"left\">Marunouchi, the heart of Tokyo's business district and home to some of the most sought out addresses.

Nursing care providers' business strategies were also greatly affected by this change. With all of the <strong><em>“Dankai generation” </em></strong>(Japan's baby boomer generation) turning over 75 years old, Japan is facing a paradigm shift in its medical and nursing care practice.</p><p>What changes should we anticipate in the medical and nursing care fields? Why do these fields need to resort to survival strategies when they were supposed to be growing industries?

The purpose of the survey was to determine whether working for either a male or female boss affect the way people work and also to understand people's perceptions on how male and female bosses manage their employees – and whether there is a difference.</p><p>Here are the results:</p><p align=\"center\"><strong>Male Boss vs Female Boss in specific situations</strong></p><p><img src=\"/media/23307/male-boss-vs-female-boss-in-specific-situations.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"442\" border=\"0\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23307/male-boss-vs-female-boss-in-specific-situations.png\"></p><p><strong>What Do You Like About Male Bosses? -&nbsp;“They are logical.”</strong></p><p align=\"center\"><strong><img src=\"/media/23308/what-do-you-like-about-male-bosses.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"375\" border=\"0\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23308/what-do-you-like-about-male-bosses.png\"></strong></p><p>According to our survey, approximately 80 percent of respondents, regardless of age or gender, answered that male bosses “think logically.” One male respondent commented, “Most female bosses have mood swings; they have their good days and bad days.”<br><br>Overall, it seems like many people think that male bosses are “logical” and their instructions are clear. On the other hand, many feel that many female bosses tend to be “emotional” – which is why they would rather be scolded by a “logical” male boss.</p><p><strong>What Don't You Like About Male Bosses? -&nbsp;“They want to take us out for drinks after work.”</strong></p><p>More than 80% of respondents answered that “male bosses” have a tendency to want to “go out for drinks after work.” Apparently, an overwhelming amount of male bosses like to socialize with their subordinates after work. While it's true that “nommunication” (Japanese term for “communication via drinking”) with managers, seniors, and colleagues often prove to be fruitful for business, recent trends show that younger generations shy away from drinking parties. It is likely that they find frequent invitations from their bosses bothersome.</p><p><strong>What Do You Like About Female Bosses? -&nbsp;“They are considerate.”</strong></p><p><img src=\"/media/23309/what-do-you-like-about-female-bosses.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"375\" border=\"0\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23309/what-do-you-like-about-female-bosses.png\"></p><p>More than 60% of respondents answered that “female bosses are more considerate.” Over 70% of female respondents provided this answer, which is 10% more than that of male respondents. As members of the same sex, they are likely to notice even the subtlest attention and care provided by their female bosses.</p><p><strong>What Don't You Like About Female Bosses? -&nbsp;“Their instructions tend to be influenced by their mood.”</strong></p><p>Approximately 60% of male respondents and 80% of female respondents answered that it is “female bosses” whose “instructions tend to be influenced by their mood.” Female respondents, as members of the same sex, responded higher than their male counterparts.</p><p><strong>Male Boss vs Female Boss – Who Do You Prefer?</strong></p><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"/media/23310/male-boss-vs-female-boss-who-do-you-prefer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" border=\"0\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23310/male-boss-vs-female-boss-who-do-you-prefer.png\"></p><p>Regardless of age or gender, approximately 70% of all respondents answered that they “prefer male bosses.” Nearly 80% of respondents in their 40's preferred male bosses – the survey showed that the higher the age group, the higher this tendency is, especially among female respondents.</p><p><strong>Does the Gender of Your Boss Affect the Way You Work? -&gt; “No” – 63.8%</strong></p><p><img src=\"/media/23311/does-how-you-work-depend-change-depending-on-the-gender-of-your-boss.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" border=\"0\" data-mce-src=\"/media/23311/does-how-you-work-depend-change-depending-on-the-gender-of-your-boss.png\"></p><p>Nearly 80% of all respondents answered “No” or “Not sure” to this question. Does this mean that “the gender of the boss does not have a huge impact on work or productivity?” Probably.<br><br>Looking further, more male respondents answered that “it affects their work” than female respondents; 26.9% of men in their 20's and 29.9% of men in their 30's responded this way. This is perhaps because younger generations have a harder time grasping their work habits and have less experience maintaining working relationships.</p><p>While you cannot generalize according to gender, many people do feel that there are differences between male bosses and female bosses from their experience.

We also introduce monks and provide selection of altars and gravestones. Up until this year, there has been around 1.2 million deaths so far. In 2042, it is anticipated that the number of deaths will rise to 1.66 million.

During his time there, Mr. Akita realized that he was more interested in building a startup rather than working in a company that was already established. Consequently, Mr. Akita left the company after 3 months to join a newly formed startup named Minrevi. Starting off working as part time, Mr. Akita studied sales, marketing and the funeral industry to gain the necessary expertise to successfully grow the business. Within 6 months after joining the company, Mr. Akita was able to expand the web service to 200 participating businesses and also achieved 300 call enquiries for the funeral web service. Furthermore, Mr. Akita has contributed to the success of a funeral service provider that used to earn 3 million yen a month which now earns 12 million yen in sales.

With this goal in mind, Servcorp is proud to announce the newest addition to its suite of premier office locations with the April 12th launch of its largest global flagship office in Beijing's Fortune Financial Center — the city's newest and tallest commercial building in the heart of the central business district.</p><p>To mark the occasion, the Honourable Tony Abbott MP, Prime Minister of Australia, attended opening ceremonies for the Fortune Financial Center during his trade delegation's visit to the city.</p><p>Servcorp, which first began serving Australia's office market in 1978, is a publicly listed company on Sydney's Australian Securities Exchange, and it was named the country's “Largest Service Exporter” in 2012. The Prime Minister's humbling visit is further testament to Servcorp's global achievements, and its successful provision of flexible premiere office solutions to companies operating in China. Servcorp is honored to receive such a distinguished visit from the Prime Minister to mark the memorable occasion, and proudly unveiled the Beijing office's new “Sydney Boardroom” during his visit, which commemorates the ties between Servcorp's Australian roots and the beloved city of Sydney.</p><p>Reflecting our core tenets of an unparalleled global IT network, professional team, and the most flexible lease terms in the industry, the Fortune Financial Center in Beijing is a prime example of the premium office solutions Servcorp strives to provide to our clients worldwide. Conveniently located in the heart of Beijing's central business district, the Fortune Finance Center was built to be both ecological and user-friendly, coming fully equipped with a state of the art air purification system. Boasting the largest commercial garden in Beijing, the building also offers a 360-degree view of the surrounding urban landscape, including the iconic CCTV building, Mandarin Oriental Beijing, Ritan Park, and is nestled amongst a mecca of famous luxury brands, 5 Star hotels, serviced apartments and Michelin starred restaurants. Businesses of all sizes will undoubtedly benefit from Servcorp's newest location and comprehensive suite of office services.</p><p>Thirty-six years after our CEO, Alf Moufarrige, first revolutionized the office industry by crowd sourcing his own office needs after becoming frustrated with the overwhelming overhead costs of traditional leases, Servcorp now offers clients access to more than 140 locations in 52 cities worldwide. Located in some of the most recognizable landmarks in the world, Servcorp's premier offices and virtual office solutions have enabled businesses of any size to access previously unaffordable prestigious office addresses, receptionist services, and a globally acclaimed team of professional support staff.</p><p>This year also marks Servcorp China's 15th anniversary since launching its first Chinese flagship office location in Shanghai in 1999. Servcorp's presence in the Middle Kingdom has grown to include over ten prestigious locations across Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Hong Kong. We are incredibly proud to celebrate this milestone with Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his delegation for the grand opening of our Servcorp Fortune Financial Center Beijing location, marking the success of yet another great Australian brand in China.</p>"},{"NodeName":"Servcorp Business Shorts at Marunouchi Trust Tower Main","PageName":"Servcorp Business Shorts at Marunouchi Trust Tower Main","PageTitle":"Servcorp Business Shorts at Marunouchi Trust Tower Main - News | Servcorp","MetaKeyword":"Servcorp Business Shorts at Marunouchi Trust Tower Main,　News, Servcorp","MetaDescription":"Servcorp Business Shorts at Marunouchi Trust Tower Main - Servcorp News","HeaderScript":"","BodyFooterScript":"","IsFeature":true,"Title":"\n<p class=\"font-bold\">Servcorp Business Shorts at Marunouchi Trust\nTower - Main</p>\n","DateCreated":"April 2014","Author":"Servcorp","Summary":"\n<p>Servcorp Business Shorts at Marunouchi Trust Tower Main on\nWednesday, April 16th.</p>\n","Thumnail":"12358/news-image-bs-marunouchi-","A_Title":"Servcorp Business Shorts at Marunouchi Trust Tower Main","A_Date":"April 2014 ","A_Author":"Servcorp","A_Content":"<div style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid currentColor;\" data-mce-style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid currentColor;\"><span style=\"color: #e0a33a; font-weight: bold;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #e0a33a; font-weight: bold;\">Afterword</span><br><br>We were pleased to have 32 participants from a wide variety of industries attend our Business Shorts.

When he graduated, his dad, seeing the need for someone with IT savvy and vision, talked him into coming on board.</p><p>Twenty years later, Servcorp is still best known as a commercial property company providing serviced offices. Certainly this is the bread and butter of the business – in the preliminary results released last week the company reported serviced office revenue of $144.19 million for the 12 months ended June 30, 2013, more than 70 per cent of the total.</p><p>What is more interesting though is the $56.37 million that Servcorp's virtual office business generated. Servcorp's release to the Australian Securities Exchange last week does not say much beyond the fact that “the company is satisfied with the performance of the virtual office business” and plans to grow it.</p><p>Marcus Moufarrige describes it as a major transition for Servcorp and points out that the virtual office services provide higher margins and tap into 21st century technology and workplace trends.</p><p>As well as being a commercial property company serving a small number of large clients, Servcorp is becoming a cloud-based technology company serving tens of thousands of small ones.</p><p><strong> Workplace trend changes</strong> <br>Virtual office services basically allow entrepreneurs to fake having an office. They can set up a local number almost anywhere in the world and arrange for a local receptionist to take the call and direct or divert it according to instructions. For an additional fee, they can also have an address to handle mail and provide rooms for occasional meetings. “It's a marketing tool if you bring it down to brass tacks,” admits Moufarrige. “Any business anywhere in the world can go online and establish a representative or sales office instantly, whether it's Saudi Arabia or Shanghai.”</p><p>This side of the business is well positioned for 21st century trends around the future of work: the rise of people working from home or from co-working spaces, the mobile workforce, the proliferation of start-ups using online outsourcing and small businesses using cloud to push into Asia without a hefty outlay of cash.</p><p>The founder and chief executive of co-working space The Hub, Brad Krauskopf predicts that in the future, “your head office will need to have a kitchen, a lab and a classroom – and not much else”.</p><p>It is an area that all commercial property companies are watching closely. For example, AMP Capital is talking to companies like The Hub to look at the possibility of providing co-working spaces within its buildings. The company has also designed its Young Street project at Circular Quay in Sydney to be more of a lifestyle precinct than a traditional office development.</p><p>AMP's office and industrial managing director Louise Mason says technology means people do not need to work in an office any more, so the office building needs to be more appealing in order to compete.</p><p>“AMP Capital has a large office portfolio and they're premium buildings, in great locations, in the major cities in Australia and we hold those assets for a long time, so it's really important for us to know the future of these buildings for the next 30 to 40 years,” Mason says. “What's coming out of our research is that while people may work from different sites and home, they'll have a great desire to collaborate and connect back together again, so providing spaces for that within a tenancy or a precinct like the Circular Quay area, we see as highly important for the future.”</p><p>Moufarrige and Mason both say any decline in the importance of the CBD will be gradual and their traditional office businesses are not under threat any time soon.</p><p>The original idea behind Servcorp's virtual office services came well before Marcus joined the business. His father's idea was to build infrastructure such as PABX telephone systems for the serviced offices and to sell the excess capacity as a virtual service supplement the real estate income. The view was that an additional 30 to 50 virtual clients per location would be ideal.</p><p>But after Marcus came on board the investment in technology over the past two decades made the system scalable enough that each physical location can now support thousands of additional virtual clients, though the actual average is lower.</p><p>“We're still recognised as a real estate business, but in actual fact in the last eight years we've made a huge effort to transform into a real estate and technology services business,” Moufarrige says.</p><p>“With our investment in technology and building the platform the way we have, it's become a lot more important than that, it's a major component of our business. We've gone from having potential for 5000 virtual office clients to 35,000 and I think we've got potential to get to 100,000 virtual office clients within the next five years.”</p><p><strong> More leading edge than bleeding edge</strong> <br>Moufarrige worked his way up through the IT department and became CIO in 2000. He says Servcorp made some good technology decisions and also some dud ones, usually erring on the side of being too far ahead of the curve.</p><p>“We were too early on some things – we rolled out Microsoft Office as a service in 2002, which was a bit too early for cloud,” Moufarrige says. “It had very low take-up and wasn't a successful deployment; we're only just about to launch another 12 years later. Sometimes you can go from leading edge to bleeding edge but mostly I think we've made good decisions.”</p><p>The IT decisions that Moufarrige says Servcorp got right include switching the entire company to voice-over IP telephony in 2000, adopting cloud computing technology internally early on and keeping IT development in-house to grow expertise. “We didn't even use integrators to buy our equipment,” Moufarrige recalls.</p><p>The company built an information management system 10 years ago that has been run from a centralised data centre in Japan since 2004. Every transaction for every client goes through that system and only now is the company looking to replace it, possibly with an off-the-shelf cloud software product. Moufarrige is particularly proud of the automated systems that allow someone to set up a phone number instantly and change call handling instructions instantly via the website or an iPhone app.</p><p><strong> Cloud as enabler for SMEs in the Asian century </strong><br> Servcorp is in 130 locations in 22 countries around the world, with a particularly strong presence in Asia and the Middle East. The company employs 140 people in Japan and claims to be the largest exporter of services to Japan outside the mining industry. It has sites in several cities in China, two in India, plus Hong Kong, Singapore and Manila.</p><p>As a result of direct experience, Moufarrige is passionate about the opportunities for Australian businesses in Asia. He sits on the national standing committee for cloud computing and is sometimes frustrated by the emphasis on trying to get the government to adopt cloud, which he flatly says he is “not interested” in. The real game, he says, is viewing cloud as a tool for small businesses to export their services.</p><p>“The huge population base to our north is where Australian companies should be pushing,” he says. “The cloud breaks down geographic barriers.”</p><p>Naturally this applies to Servcorp – their platform is cloud-based, which allows someone in France to order a telephone service in Singapore, which is billed by Servcorp in Japan and the profits are sent back to Australia.</p><p>But Moufarrige also makes the same point about other cloud providers, such as Xero accounting software, which has packages online for other jurisdictions, allowing an Australian accounting firm to serve a client in Singapore and bill them in local currency.</p><p>Moufarrige has mixed feelings about the national broadband network – he says anything that delivers better broadband is a good thing, but thinks it is a missed opportunity to invest in better undersea cables to the rest of the world, particularly Singapore, Japan and the US.</p><p><strong> Succession planning</strong> <br>Alf Moufarrige founded Servcorp in 1978 and still owns over half the business. His older son Taine is a non-executive director and Marcus is being groomed to take over the business.</p><p>Marcus describes his father as “pretty bullet-proof” but also “reasonably pragmatic” about his age – he's 72 – and the need for succession planning.</p><p>“We're changing the business, not losing our entrepreneurial spirit but changing from being run by an entrepreneur to being run by a more highly skilled management team,” Marcus says. “We're building a sales force and business intelligence infrastructure to handle the scale that we've built to and we're having a lot of success with that. We're doing that in Australia, south-east Asia and America, then I'll probably take over China and Alf would just be left with Japan and the Middle East. It would happen over the next three to five years and we'll take it one geography at a time.”</p><p>He is doubtful the ownership would change as a result, “given he's still pretty excited about the business and thinks it's a good place for his money to be invested.” As for Marcus, being CEO of Servcorp may not have been his goal 20 years ago, but he is happy with the prospect now.</p><p>“I probably had a view that I was the weakest one within that competitive family and I wanted to prove myself, but I've now reconciled that I can well and truly do that inside the business as opposed to having to go outside the business,” he says.</p>"},{"NodeName":"Marunouchi Trust Tower Halloween Muffin Run","PageName":"Marunouchi Trust Tower Halloween Muffin Run","PageTitle":"Marunouchi Trust Tower Halloween Muffin Run - News | Servcorp","MetaKeyword":"Marunouchi Trust Tower Halloween Muffin Run,News, Servcorp","MetaDescription":"Marunouchi Trust Tower Halloween Muffin Run - Servcorp News","HeaderScript":"","BodyFooterScript":"","IsFeature":true,"Title":"\n<p class=\"font-bold\">Marunouchi Trust Tower Halloween Muffin\nRun</p>\n","DateCreated":"November 2013","Author":"Servcorp","Summary":"\n<p>The Servcorp Marunouchi team organized a Halloween themed\n\"Muffin run.\" on Thursday, October 31st.</p>\n","Thumnail":"11467/news-image-marunouchi-muffinrun","A_Title":"Marunouchi Trust Tower Halloween Muffin Run","A_Date":"November  2013","A_Author":"Servcorp","A_Content":"<p>On October 31st, the Servcorp Marunouchi team organized a Halloween themed “Muffin run.”</p><p>The team delivered Halloween candies including witch/ghost lollipops, all of which were creatively wrapped by the team.</p><p>The wrapping was cute and so nicely done that several clients were shocked when they found out that they were hand-made.

Through this experience, I have discovered that when the focus on development is only on the IT related part of the system, you are not addressing the real demand of the users. In order to accurately meet the users' needs, development methods need to be expanded, and that is how we have constructed the business development methodology named Takumi (匠) Method. By using the Takumi Method, our company provides consulting services on developing effective business and IT strategies, work restructuring and improving development processes.</p><p>Upon using the Takumi Method to restructure and improve clients' businesses, I have also discovered the great importance of visualizing the concept of “value”.</p><p>What is value?<br> How do values get created?<br> What is Japan's weaknesses and strengths from a value perspective?</p><p>These are the topics I would like to discuss during the presentation. Rather than being IT specific, the presentation will touch the subject on a more broad scale so it will be easy to undertand for any audience.</p><p><strong>Speaker Profile </strong><br>Mr. Junzo Hagimoto(President, Takumi Business Place Corporation)</p><p>In 2000, Mr. Junzo Hagimoto started a company specializing in object-oriented technology, named Mamezou Co, Ltd. He managed the business as the IT architect and methodologist until 2008.</p><p>In addition, Mr. Hagimoto was involved in several government related IT projects for 3 years since 2005, including taking part in the role as Technical Advisor for Administrative Management Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; and also as the Advisor for Government Promotion and Management Office (GPMO) of IT Policy Office of Cabinet Secretariat.</p><p>In July 2009, Mr. Hagimoto established Takumi Business Place Corporation. He has developed the “Takumi Method” by constantly expanding and refining the requirement development method – a process which is necessary to visualize both business and IT values. He has the hands-on experience at a company that was a systems user, and he has also made innovative changes to the restructuring process of business operations at IT companies through his method.</p><p><strong>Date</strong><br>Thursday, July 18th<br> 18:30 Reception open<br> 19:00 Presentation starts<br> 19:40 Networking<br> 20:30 Close</p><p><strong>Venue</strong><br>Level 27 Shiroyama Trust Tower<br>4-3-1 Toranomon, Minato-ku<br><br> 2 min walk from Exit 4b of Kamiyacho Station on Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line.<br> 5 min walk from Exit 2 of Roppongi-Icchome Station on Tokyo Metro Namboku Line.</p><p>We look forward to seeing you there!

Fukuoka Tenjin Fukoku Seimei Building provides a fantastic view of this famous event, and it has allowed us to experience the vibrant energy and culture of Fukuoka's renowned traditional festival.</p><p><strong> Servcorp Fukuoka Tenjin Fukoku Seimei Building</strong><br> Level 15 Fukuoka Tenjin Fukoku Seimei Building<br> 1-9-17 Tenjin Chuo-ku<br> Fukuoka 810-0001 Japan<br> T 092 717 3400<br> Email: <a href=\"mailto:tenjin@servcorp.co.jp\" data-mce-href=\"mailto:tenjin@servcorp.co.jp\">tenjin@servcorp.co.jp</a><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></p>"},{"NodeName":"Servcorp Business Shorts at Yebisu Garden Place Tower","PageName":"Servcorp Business Shorts at Yebisu Garden Place Tower","PageTitle":"Servcorp Business Shorts at Yebisu Garden Place Tower - News | Servcorp","MetaKeyword":"Servcorp Business Shorts at Yebisu Garden Place Tower,News, Servcorp","MetaDescription":"Servcorp Business Shorts at Yebisu Garden Place Tower - Servcorp News","HeaderScript":"","BodyFooterScript":"","IsFeature":true,"Title":"\n<p class=\"font-bold\">Servcorp Business Shorts at Yebisu Garden\nPlace Tower</p>\n","DateCreated":"May 2013","Author":"Servcorp","Summary":"\n<p>Servcorp Business Shorts at Yebisu Garden Place Tower on\nThursday, May 23rd.</p>\n","Thumnail":"9995","A_Title":"Servcorp Business Shorts at Yebisu Garden Place Tower","A_Date":"May 2013 ","A_Author":"Servcorp","A_Content":"<div style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid currentColor;\" data-mce-style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid currentColor;\"><span style=\"color: #e0a33a; font-weight: bold;\" data-mce-style=\"color: #e0a33a; font-weight: bold;\">Afterword</span><br><br>We were pleased to have many participants from a wide variety of industries attend our Business Shorts.

However, despite the familiarity, there still remains a gap between people's perceived impression of lawyers and reality. Through this presentation, I will be providing an overview of how to get the most out of legal services by mainly explaining how the legal fee system works.</p><p><strong>Speaker Profile </strong><br>Mr. Shiro Nakayama(Lawyer Ernesto Law Office)</p><p>Mr. Shiro Nakayama graduated from Hitotsubashi University – Faculty of Law - and started his career at Nippon Steel Corporation. During his time at Nippon Steel Corporation, he started off his career in the Iron and Steel division, working in Sales, Production and Engineering to get an overall understanding of the business operations. He later on obtained the role of consultant and developer in the Urban Development division, in which he gained extensive hands-on experience in the legal area, including work which required knowledge with the Building Code, Large-Scale Retail Stores Location Law, Land Readjustment Act, Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act, etc. He has also obtained negotiation skills for negotiating delegation agreements, outsourcing agreements, beneficiary right agreements, shareholders agreements, etc. He left the company in 2004 to pursue his graduate studies at Surugadai University's Faculty of Law and Law Research Department. In 2008, Mr. Nakayama obtained his degree and registered with the Tokyo Bar Association.</p><p>Mr. Nakayama then worked as an Associate Lawyer at Tetsumaru Hatanaka Firm, LPC, and later on worked for Bridge Roots for 3 years, in which 2 years were spent working as a Representative Lawyer for the Tokyo office, providing legal support to active small and medium sized businesses. Bridge Roots also has a branch office in Shanghai that was very competitive in the Chinese legal area, and that has allowed Mr. Nakayama to also enhance his experience with dealing issues between Japanese and Chinese businesses.</p><p>In August 2012, Mr. Nakayama established Ernesto Law Office. His company's goal is to provide extensive services which allow the customer to experience some truly valuable legal service. Currently, Mr. Nakayama's main interests involve conflicts with real estate, labour and bankruptcy/rehabilitation.</p><p><strong>Date</strong><br>Thursday, May 23rd<br> 18:30 Reception open<br> 19:00 Presentation starts<br> 19:40 Networking<br> 20:30 Close</p><p><strong>Venue</strong><br>Level 18 Yebisu Garden Place Tower<br>4-20-3 Ebisu Shibuya-ku<br><br> 5 min walk from directly connected East Exit of Yebisu Station on JR Line*<br> 7 min walk from Exit 1 of Yebisu Station on Hibiya Line.<br>(A moving sidewalk “Ebisu Sky Walk” available)</p><p>We look forward to seeing you there!

Hibiya staff members gathered all of the guests together for a fun quiz game, where participants were asked Olympic-related quizzes, and they had to choose the correct answer from two choices. The top 10 clients with the highest scores received gorgeous prizes, many of which were donated by the clients located in Hibiya Central Building. Gifts included an accommodation coupon for a new luxurious hotel in Bali, stylish yet well-performing hard drive/mobile drive &amp; USB memory set, world-famous Hungarian salami and handy travel kits. There was laughter throughout the game, so the guests seemed to be having a great time - especially the very lucky and knowledgeable 10 who have received prizes!</p><p>Towards the end of the charity event, our guests had time to talk to one another and introduce themselves and their company.

One of attractions was a mini golf course in the boardroom with an easy level course and a more challenging uphill course. The other attraction was a mini darts game. Anyone who got a hole-in-one in the mini golf game or a bulls-eye in the mini darts game was awarded with one free drink ticket along with a “Congratulations!” photo with the team under the Servcorp umbrella. It was a great sight to see clients who were very skilled at the games teaching others and having a great time. Consolation prizes were also given out, so everyone had a chance to win.</p><p>Following the carnival games, a charity auction was held where clients can bid for gorgeous prizes such as an Yves Saint Lauren jewelry box and five star hotel dinner tickets for two. Each manager promoted the items and had all attendees make their bid to win the prize. The auction was extremely popular among the attendees, allowing participants to interact with each other and have a fun competition.</p><p>There was some great feedback after the event. All the clients had a fun time networking, and some particularly enjoyed meeting clients from other Servcorp locations. The games were one of the highlights of the night, and the clients said that they have had a lot of fun with the Servcorp team. Many were also able to further understand the purpose of Servcorp's annual charity events for the Tyler foundation and were excited to invite their own business partners and friends and family to the upcoming charity event next year.</p><p>Overall, with the support of Nomura and Nittochi clients, we were able to raise a total of <strong>129,887 yen</strong> from the American Carnival charity event.

Beads of Courage program by the Tyler Foundation – a non-profit organization dedicated to help children with cancer and the families of those children. To raise funds for the foundation, each Servcorp location hosts a charity event in which the Servcorp staff decorates the office and plans exciting, recreational activities for the clients. Through these fundraisers, we aim to provide entertainment for our clients and at the same time, support the Tyler Foundation.</p><p>On June 21st, the Otemachi Tokyo Sankei Building location held a charity event named “Sankei Magic Show!”</p><p>The Servcorp staff decorated the office with luxurious ornaments shaped as symbols on playing cards – hearts, spades, clovers and diamonds – to create the magic show atmosphere. Guests were fascinated with the special décor and said that they felt like they were in a casino. One also said, “What a luxurious atmosphere! What is going to happen tonight?!”</p><p>Furthermore, the Servcorp staff all dressed up as magicians in classic white shirts with red ties and welcomed the arriving guests.</p><p>There was actually more to the magician costume than just dressing up for the magic theme. The staff actually practiced magic tricks several days before the event to surprise the guests. Their efforts were paid off when they finally performed their magic:</p><p>In the middle of the event, two staff members jumped out of the crowd to the centre of the boardroom. One of them tore a sheet of black paper, and when she gave one puff to one of the torn sheets, the sheet suddenly became a silk hat! <br> Everyone applauded and was amazed by the staff's hidden talent, but this was not the end. The moment the staff placed the silk hat on a guest's head, the silk hat started shaking and a cute rabbit jumped out of the hat! Wave of laughter and a storm of applause echoed throughout the floor during the magic show.</p><p>The guests enjoyed not only the magic show, but also handmade sweets made by the staff, which were traditional Japanese red bean paste sandwiched between 2 pancakes (called “Dorayaki”), chocolate caramel muffins, fresh banana cake and rich cheese cake. They were all sold out instantly.</p><p>We would like to express our appreciation to all the guests who have participated in our charity event, and also to those who have donated even though they could not join the event. The funds raised have been donated to the Tyler Foundation.</p><p>Thank you for attending this event despite everyone's busy schedules.</p><p>Servcorp will continue to hold charity events like this at each location.

I believe that people who cannot brand themselves will eventually be removed from the workforce. During my presentation, I will explain how to “brand” people, a procedure that is different from building a corporate brand.

Business owners need a solution which removes the hassles of the day-to-day running of an office so they can focus on increasing their bottom line and succeeding in any market. An ideal office solution is an important factor that will help them focus solely on their business goals while having a professional presence they deserve. The effort of having to source the right office in the right location and dealing with exorbitant rental fees, set-up costs, furniture and IT set up can be quite stressful on its own, and this is even before you consider hiring staff to run all this. It's not only the hassle of sourcing an office solution, but also the time spent on putting this in place. Having a Serviced or Virtual office provides the means to develop a business without having to fork out extensive overhead costs. With Servcorp businesses can sign up and are immediately equipped with an office, support team and IT available to support them when required. This can be for as short or long as needed without having to sign off on any long-term agreements. These office solutions can take away the stress, effort and expense of having to manage an office because it's already set up and ready to use. Serviced and Virtual Offices provide a unique suite of offerings that can be tailored to suit the needs of businesses and are designed to help companies increase sales while maintaining a work-life balance. Whether it is a receptionist who is the voice and face of the company or innovative IT technology solutions or meeting room facilities, the possibilities are broad and many. Or if the need for a global presence arises, businesses can reach any market with unprecedented ease and convenience. Servcorp can provide this for the cost of running a business locally. The accessibility of running a business online and having the technology to support this and a professional business presence is what can be the defining factor that helps a business stand out from the competition. Servcorp is a unique international organisation that provides Serviced and Virtual Offices and IT solutions to businesses across the globe. A proudly Australian owned company and the world's leading provider, offers over 120 locations in 22 countries throughout Australia and New Zealand, Asia, the USA, Europe and the Middle East—including eight premier locations in Sydney's CBD, Bondi Junction, North Sydney, Norwest Business Park, North Ryde and Parramatta.

Unfortunately, there was also no established market for the serviced office product and subsequently very few clients or enquiries for the first five months. Back then, the Servcorp team had to “dial-up” over modems to receive e-mail and did not have a voicemail system. Receptionists manually transferred phone calls using a hardcopy of the client's contact details and an old fashioned switchboard. The manager typed lease agreements on the type-writer and calculated invoices manually.</p><p><strong>The Journey</strong></p><p>The Servcorp journey over the last 15 years in Japan has revolutionised the serviced office industry. Servcorp went from very simple analogue phone systems (PABX) requiring our receptionists to individually transfer phone calls to state-of-the-art fully integrated IP phone technology offering phone calls over the internet.</p><p>Servcorp pioneered voicemail with the Servcorp Unified messaging system and more advanced products such as Servcorp Onefone and Servcorp Onefax. Servcorp has advanced from simple “dial-up” internet systems to business grade, reliable, high-speed broadband internet solutions. The technical support team has grown to ten technology experts in Japan.</p><p>In 1996 we opened a second floor in Shinjuku, followed by our Kamiyacho Shiroyama Gardens location in 1997. Since then Servcorp has opened floors every year, with a break in 2002, 2003 and 2008.
